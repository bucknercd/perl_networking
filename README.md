# perl_networking
This repo has a scan.pl network scanner. This is a command line tool and will ping host(s) and scan ports 1-10000.
$scan.pl -h  produces usage.

connect is another program that one can use to connect to a server with. provide no arguments to see usage.


Note: scan.pl must be run as root now for it to work since it uses icmp for pings.
